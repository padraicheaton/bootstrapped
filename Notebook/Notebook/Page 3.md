# Ethics Application
I decided not to submit this rotation seeing as I had heaps of questions regarding many parts of the application, and I didn't want to submit it without definitely knowing the answers
## Questions
### Project Title Page
- [ ] Is the Application Title the same as the Project Title? At the moment I have them as the same, if so do I need to submit a project title change form? As my current official project title is not the same as the one I am using now
- [ ] This isn't a Pilot study right?
### Investigators Page
- [ ] Internal personnel listed on this ethics protocol: I am not primary, and Jaime is correct?
- [ ] What formal qualifications do I list for myself and Jaime?
### Methodology
- [ ] Verify both Quantitative and Qualitative Methodology/Methods
