# The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has finally landed. Here's why it's such a cultural juggernaut

**Intro goes here.** Eg Something like: Today millions of people – adults and children alike – woke early, jumped out of bed and ran to their Nintendo switch, eager to play [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.zelda.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/).

This freshly released game, a sequel to the 2017 release [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/), has been long awaited by Zelda fans around the globe, and the subject of vast amounts of breathless coverage in both specialist gaming media and the [mainstream press](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/04/arts/zelda-nintendo-history.html). 

So, what is this game and why is it such big news – even among those who don't necessarily see themselves as "gamers"?

I'm a researcher who creates games, and studies how to make them even better. Here's what you need to know about why Zelda is back in the news headlines – and why it's such a huge cultural phenomenon.

## What is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom?

A bit of backstory here, what we know so far eg "Despite the name, the protagonist at the centre of this game is Link, a young knight who is blah blah blah and he gotta do xyz.... In the previous game, Breath of the Wild, he had to do such and such and so and so

From promotional videos etc we know that the new game must do blah and blah and blah. 

However, this time he is not limited to running around the land or floating around on his paraglider but in fact can do x and y and z in the sky etc etc etc (ie give the readers a little taste of what TOTK is about, but don't feel you have to say EVERYTHING new about the latest game here, because we will return to that theme later).

## Why was Breath of the Wild such a, well, game-changer?

In this bit you can wax lyrical about why botw was so appealing to so many. For example:

- the puzzles
- the way the storyline unfolds gently and intriguingly
- something about the graphics? The way nature is such a huge part of it
- allowed people to play in different ways depending on their mood eg if you were keen to battle, you could do that but if you really only had the emotional energy to pick mushrooms then you could just do that
- sense of freedom wandering around this vast natural world (possibly particularly appealing to people during lockdown)
- something about how good it feels to paraglide over such large spaces? Up to you
- any other shit you can think of

## What do we know so far about Tears of the Kingdom?

Here you can talk about what we know so far about totk and why it's cool eg

- the ability to put different things together to create new weapons, vehicles or tools (such as the hot air ballon etc).
- the huge increase on the area you can exploe (ie not only a vast land but also the sky)
- whatever else

## Summing up or conclusion section

In this bit you just sum it all up. In your view, why has Zelda become such a big cultural phenomenon? Why is it so beloved by people from so many different countries, age groups, demographics?

And maybe finish with a line on why you personally are looking forward to totk or may even be playing it right now as the reader reads this sentence! Up to you.
