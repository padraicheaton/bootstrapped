## Module 1
### Dynamic Arrays
- Implemented a custom class called 'Dynamic Array' that stores an array container that grows and shrinks as needed
- Began writing it as only storing integers, but will refactor to be generic so that any data structure can be contained
- Converted the previously unordered dynamic array list to an ordered list that always stores the values in order from smallest to largest
	- This is an addition to the 'Add' method of the class that inserts the new value at the correct index - to retain the order
- We then implemented a 'Rectangle' class that inherited from 'IComparable' so that it can be compared to other instances of itself, and then be stored in the newly generic dynamic list class we have created

### Algorithm Analysis
- What?: Analysing how an algorithm will run, how long it will take and how many resources it will use
- We evaluate this based on the worst case scenario due to there not being anything worse than that, i.e. if it can handle the worst case, it can handle anything
