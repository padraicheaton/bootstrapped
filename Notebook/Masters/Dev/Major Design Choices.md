# Gameplay Design
## Gameplay Loop Broken into Phases
The gameplay loop has been broken into a fighting phase and a spending phase. During the fighting phase, the player cannot get new weapons and must defeat all enemies with the weapons they have selected. This phase ends when the player has defeated all enemies. The spending phase is when the player uses all collected currency to generate weapons from the Foundry, and to select which weapons they would like to bring into the next wave. This phase is ended when the player triggers the next wave.

This distinction has been made so that the player has time to sort through and select which weapons they would like to use for the next wave, without the pressure of fighting off enemies at the same time. This allows the player to make much more educated and thoughtful decisions on the weapons they use, resulting in better tracked metrics and therefore better overall weapon recommendations. Overall, this choice lets the player focus on the task at hand and removes the overhead of multitasking.

## Player Triggers Enemy Waves
For the next wave to begin, the player must manually trigger it to occur. This has been decided so that the player is able to elect when they are ready and prepared to begin the next wave of enemies. This allows players as much time as required for them to get their weapon selection ready, and to mentally prepare to face enemies.

## Gameplay Loop = Endless Wave
The overall design of the gameplay loop is that of a traditional Roguelite, where the player enters the level and tries to survive as long as they can whilst acquiring currency and defeating enemies. Once they are defeated by the enemies they are brought back to the 'home base' level where they can use the acquired currency to purchase upgrades to increase their chances of surviving longer on the next playthrough.

As a result of this design, the player will play for longer and longer durations with little punishments for failing the gameplay loop (as eventually every player will). This allows both new players and veteran players being catered for as all players play for as long as they can and can instantly start again from the beginning when needed. Further, as the quality of the weapon generations naturally increases over time (as more data is recorded), longer and more rapid playthroughs will provide the player with better weapons (hopefully)

## Upgrades as the Progression System
The only lasting progression system in the game is the upgrade system. This gives the player something to always work towards and to make decisions on what they want to be currently aiming for to unlock. This gives the player a reason to keep going back into the level to defeat more enemies, get more currency and unlock more upgrades. This is a good motivator to keep the player playing the game over and over, and therefore thoroughly testing the prototype.

# Weapon Design
## Hold Multiple Weapons at Once
Giving the player the ability to simultaneously use multiple weapons at once allows the player to find unique synergies between two weapon combinations. It allows the player even more freedom in playing style variation through combining two configurations for even more emergent effects. The player will also be able to have weapons in reserve once their other weapons run out of ammunition. Further, for the genetic algorithm selecting parents given a fitness function that considers the equipped weapons, there are more weapons to be used as parents rather than a single genotype being selected as both parents.

## Weapons are Generated by the Foundry
The only way the player can generate more weapons to be used is by interacting with the Foundry, which is located at the centre of the map near where the player spawns. This has been decided so that all generated weapons are located in the same place, at the same time allowing the player to more easily sort through all weapons and select the ones they want to use. From an [[Algorithm Design]] point of view, this also mimics the population pool of traditional genetic algorithms rather than generating one weapon at a time.

## Weapons Can Only be Reloaded by Refill Stations
This design choice was both difficult and important. Weapon reloading is an integral part of many games within the First Person Shooter genre, therefore the removal of that constitutes a removal of a core foundational feature. This was done to encourage play style exploration, and to make the use of a weapon more strategic. With the weapon only allowing for a finite amount of uses, the player must choose wisely when and where to use them. Further, this inclusion adds meaning to duplicate generated weapons as it now represents more uses of a favoured weapon. This design choice promotes play style exploration (which is fundamental to the aim of this project), suppresses the impact of potential over-fitting, creates an inherently more strategic gameplay loop and adds to the overall mood of the game

The player has the ability to unlock Refill stations that will spawn around the map allowing the player to interact with it and reload their equipped weapon. Locking this behind an upgrade gives more weight to reloading weapons, and signifies that it should only be reserved for the player reloading their favourite or most useful weapon. From a gameplay point of view, this gives the player reason to explore the map and run around. From an [[Algorithm Design]] point of view, this is a strong indicator that the player prefers the specific weapon reloaded.

## Starting Weapon can be Selected
The player can choose the weapon they start the game with through a selection shop that presents the player with 10 random weapons (selected each time the 'home base' is loaded), giving the player to 'buy' one to start the levels with. This is locked behind an upgrade as it is a core thing the  player should be working towards. From a gameplay point of view, this allows the player to manually select a weapon that they like and can quickly get into the experience without having to search for it. From an algorithmic point of view, this gives a strong indication that the player like/prefers that weapon genotype.

# Enemy Design
## Enemy Visuals are Based on Function
There are various types of enemies that all have unique functions with some applying effects such as: damage, fire, knockback, magnetic, etc. And each have distinct visuals. This is so that the player can identify what each enemy will do very quickly, allowing them to quickly strategize how to engage the enemy.

## Enemies Fly with Variable Hover Height
Every enemy is technically flying, whilst most have a hover height that makes them appear to move along the ground. This is so that the enemies can avoid obstacles and variations in the ground much easier, so that they do not become stuck on the terrain. Further, the enemies will move upwards given an obstacle in front of them, for the same reason.

# Environmental Design
## Large, Static Map Design
As opposed to a PCG level design, the map is now a large static level with 5 distinct areas. These areas are specifically designed to cater towards certain playstyles, with the environment lending itself to different approaches. For example, there is an area that features a large tower in the corner coupled with a large open space in front of it - benefitting players that enjoy sniping or laying traps.
