## Mechanic Teaching Philosophy
This has been derived from [[Knowledge Encoding in Game Mechanics]] as well as the popular game concept of 'invisible tutorials'.

**For Each Mechanic to Teach:**
- **Demonstration:** Demonstrate the mechanic to the player, this could be achieved in a variety of ways. The game's environment could indicate the mechanic, with possibly showing the after effects of the mechanic being used. A small preview could be shown or otherwise displayed to the player of the mechanic. A short gameplay section could stop the player and force them to interact with the mechanic, for example a small ledge requiring the player to jump to continue.
- **Experimentation:** Allow the player to experiment with the mechanic in a zero-low risk environment, provide the player with some directors to experiment. For example, with introducing a gun, give the player something to shoot at that is of zero-low threat to them.
- **Reinforcement:** Quickly reinforce the mechanic in a (relatively) higher risk environment, preferably with a minor twist to demonstrate that the mechanic can be applied to different situations. 

## High Level Tutorial Design
The design philosophy should follow the intended learning trajectory of the player, with the level of knowledge abstraction increasing over time, and the level of explicit guidance decreasing over time. This is very similar to real-world teaching strategies as one who's eager to learn requires [[Knowledge Encoding in Game Mechanics#Declarative Knowledge]] before they can motivate themselves to carry on the process. 

**As the Tutorial Progresses:**
- Linearity *decreases*
- Explicit guidance *decreases*
- Mechanic complexity *increases*
- Knowledge abstraction *increases*

[[Knowledge Encoding in Game Mechanics#Declarative Knowledge]] - Must be taught Synchronously
[[Knowledge Encoding in Game Mechanics#Progressive Knowledge]] - Can be taught Asynchronously
