	- Andrew approached me regarding some problems in the group dynamics
	- Identified 2 group members (Chunyu? and Ziyu?) as problem students, argumentative, non-cooperational and unwilling to subscribe to the Agile process
	- Will have a meeting with Jaime to discuss options, but have floated the following ideas:
		- Splitting the two problem members out into their own group and provisioning revised assignment of reduced scope
		- Moving Andrew back to **Team Crunch | 5pm**
		- Splitting Andrew and Pei-Shan into their own group of 2 and provisioning revised assignment of reduced scope
