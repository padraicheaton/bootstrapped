## Sprint 1

### Mid-Point Prototype Feedback
- Awesome so far, big improvement from previous weeks
- Some typos in the dialogue popups
- Cannot get past the laser, no way for me to progress further into the game
- Show the movement controls before the combat controls
- Show the player the weapon cooldown, so that the player can plan accordingly whether or not to engage in combat
- More level, more art, more...
- Take some inspiration from Nintendo's Mechanic Teaching Philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmIkEvEBtA
	- Introduce mechanic
	- Build on the mechanic in a safe environment
	- Reinforce the mechanic with a slight twist
	- Conclude level section with a satisfying test of knowledge
	- **Repeat**
- Remove inventory from the UI if it is not implemented yet, focus on the core of the game first - then worry about the inventory if/when you have time for it
